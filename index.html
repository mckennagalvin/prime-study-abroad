                        This past summer and fall, three Daily Bruin staffers traded in a quarter at UCLA for an education abroad, joining the ranks of thousands of students each year. From walking the aromatic streets of Florence, Italy, to grabbing a drink at a local pub in London or Edinburgh, Scotland, all three found a unique flavor to their respective cities and experienced things they hadn't read or heard about. We bring you just a few of their stories &ndash; a taste of their adventures.

                    <h2>Edinburgh, Scotland</h2>

                    <span class="credit">
                        By <b>MARYROSE KULICK</b>
                    </span>
                    
                    <p>My flat sits on the corner of Sciennes in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

                    <p>Take a left out the front door and soon you&rsquo;ll hit the easternmost corner of the Meadows, a vast expanse of green grass that &ndash; on sunny days &ndash; lures barbecuers, dog owners and meanderers.</p>

                    <p>From there, turn right and walk down two blocks to reach Clerk Street, a bustling avenue for window shoppers and errand runners.</p>

                    <p>My mom and I took this route on her last night with me in Scotland&rsquo;s capital, a place known for its spire-top churches and dismally cold winters. After a day of touring the city, we turned left onto Clerk Street, and we found ourselves inside a pub-style restaurant: The Abbey.</p>

                    <p>My mom had chicken curry and rice. I had steak and potatoes. We chatted about which ATMs I should use in the city and how my brother had just moved into his first college dorm. Even though we were halfway across the world, life was still normal &ndash; conversations still familiar. But shortly the steak on my plate diminished to just a morsel, and then it was completely gone.</p>

                    <p>After exiting the pub, my mom decided to head back to her hotel to prepare for her morning flight back to the States. So we said our goodbyes, parted ways and she was gone.</p>

                    <p>And I was alone. Oh boy.</p>

                    <img src="img/edinburgh/three.jpg" />
                    <div class="caption">MARYROSE KULICK/daily bruin</div>

                    <p>No one really considers the concept of homesickness when they plan extravagant trips to new and strange countries. At least, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

                    <p>Sure, the how-to-prepare-for-life-abroad videos tell you all the warning signs, but I always thought I would be too busy, too engrossed with what was around me, to even notice that I missed home.</p>

                    <p>But as the new school year started getting underway &ndash; because yes, studying abroad does include studying &ndash; the thrill of exploring Edinburgh&rsquo;s cobblestone streets, thrifting through designer cashmere and woolen shops and experimenting with the flavors of haggis and black pudding quickly began to die down.</p>

                    <p>When I no longer had as much time for sightseeing, even the smallest things would make that horrible lonely feeling sink into my gut.</p>

                    <p>Grocery shopping, for instance &ndash; I&rsquo;ve never had to shop for only myself, and I found myself panicking over what to buy, not knowing where to find tortillas and questioning why eggs in the United Kingdom don&rsquo;t have to be refrigerated.</p>

                    <p>On multiple occasions, I made enough food for two or three but had no one to share it with. This isn&rsquo;t to say I&rsquo;ve been completely isolated from other human beings &ndash; just that no one told me how much time I&rsquo;d be spending on my own.</p>

                    <p>But one night, that itching feeling, that nagging sensation that told me to get out of California and study abroad in the first place, said, &ldquo;Hey. No.&rdquo; It refused to let me sit idly in my flat making way too much food.</p>

                    <img src="img/edinburgh/four.jpg" />
                    <div class="caption">MARYROSE KULICK/daily bruin</div>

                    <p>So the next morning, I woke up at 5:40 a.m., got dressed and ate some yogurt. By precisely 6:08 a.m., I was out the door and turning left.</p>

                    <p>When I hit the Meadows, I turned right, crossed the intersection and headed toward Clerk Street. The sun had yet to rise, which was just what I wanted.</p>

                    <p>Few people were out, other than the occasional shop owner preparing for the day. I passed a grocer sweeping broken glass off the sidewalk and nodded good morning to her while my feet moved briskly beneath me; my breath fogged my vision.</p>

                    <p>I was both nervous and excited &ndash; ahead, I could see the faint outline of a mountain looming over the still-sleeping city.</p>

                    <p>When I came to the edge of town, I made my way through an open gate into the wooded section of Holyrood Park. The street lamps were all but gone and I could barely see my feet below me, but I knew two paths were laid out before me.</p>

                    <p>By the light of my iPhone, I took the path to the left. My heart bounced around in my chest, invoking memories of counselors telling me not to walk alone at night. Did that still count at 6:30 in the morning?</p>

                    <p>I quickly made it out to the street that surrounds Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, a long-extinct volcano and Holyrood Park&rsquo;s most prominent feature. Already the sky was starting to get brighter, and I grew nervous at my pace. I had about 45 minutes to make it to the top for the sunrise at 7:30 a.m. &ndash; plenty of time, but my feet quickened to almost a run.</p>

                    <p>Halfway up the hill, my lungs were sucking in cold air and my nose was running, but the speed of my movement kept me warm. By then, the sky was light enough so that I no longer needed my phone to see the path. Stopping to switch it off, I looked back to assess my progress, and laid out behind me were hundreds of twinkling Edinburgh lights. They bounced off the Firth of Forth to the right, and it was almost serene enough for me to stop there and watch them slowly disappear.</p>

                    <p>As I kept climbing, I envisioned being the only one at the summit &ndash; the only one in the world to see the sunrise from this peak on this day, ever.</p>

                    <p>That, of course, was not the case. Two people had made it up the 250-meter summit before me, which was fine. Two more people joined us soon after. I perched myself at the highest point of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat and waited &ndash; I had 15 minutes to spare.</p>

                    <p>I sat and watched the skyline. The subtle colors of dawn created a soft, peachy hue. The lights from the city below us were still twinkling &ndash; and then, right on schedule, the sun came up.</p>

                    <p>First, the red light bouncing off of the clouds slowly began to intensify, crafting abstract jagged lines that wove themselves throughout the sky. Then, ever so slowly &ndash; as the sun is never in a rush &ndash; a bright orb emerged, washing the hilltop and the surrounding city in orange light.</p>

                    <div class="caption">MARYROSE KULICK/daily bruin</div>

                    <p>My companions and I all pulled out our cameras to capture the moment. While the earth&rsquo;s rotation makes this phenomenon a natural daily occurrence, we were still the only five people on Earth who could say we witnessed the sunrise on Oct. 9, 2015, from the top of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat.</p>

                    <p>So why did I decide to study abroad?</p>

                    <p>Like everyone else, I did it for the culture, the risk, the adventure. But for the most part, I did it for the Scottish sunrise.</p>

                    <p>Cod sizzled while we walked past a Sherlock Holmes-themed storefront. The flaky bitterness of the malt vinegar-covered fish was almost tangible through the air. On the same street was an old church, its blue and white paint flaking &ndash; almost like the fish. The archaic facade of the church seemed out of place after we cut through the garden and ended up on a modern, busy street filled with bakeries and boutiques.</p>

                    <p>This was London, this was Baker Street, this was home.</p>

                    <div class="caption">ANDREA HENTHORN/daily bruin</div>

                    <p>For three weeks, our mission was to become wanderers. Armed with maps from 1779 and mindsets from 2015, my classmates and I were led by the ghost of 18th century Romantic poet and engraver William Blake to roam the streets of London.</p>

                    <p>Blake, unlike many of his contemporaries, chose to highlight the world for what it was not. While studying, we were told by our professor to step outside the boundaries of our classroom walls, and we were shown the ghost of the old London that inspired Blake&rsquo;s critiques of authority and society. He emphasized the dual nature of his world by both criticizing and beautifying it with his words.</p>

                    <p>We were standing on the cusp of two Londons: one antiquated and belonging to Blake, one modern and belonging to us. By walking the streets one district at a time, we saw with our own eyes the reflection of what Blake wrote about in the late 18th century.</p>

                    <img src="img/london/two.jpg" />
                    <div class="caption">ANDREA HENTHORN/daily bruin</div>

                    <p>Our professor tasked us with understanding that Blake, and others like him, were surrounded by people who defined themselves along the lines of class, economics and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; time. But ironically, experiencing Blake&rsquo;s London is not unlike walking through a city today and seeing the dynamic between modern-day realists and Romantics &ndash; those who are aware of time, and those who enjoy their time.</p>

                    <p>The crackle and snap of frying cod in a white- and black-tiled restaurant is timeless, as is dinner in a conversation-filled pub with friends. The long grass in an open field at the poet John Keats&rsquo; home scratches against your legs and makes you forget that you even have a watch around your wrist.</p>

                    <p>That joyful timelessness was undermined by the other parts of life we saw: open fields turned into shopping malls, and ever-expanding business centers in previously historic districts.</p>

                    <p>Time, though we all become a slave to it at one point or another, never seemed more malleable to me than it did during the three weeks when I went from a UCLA English student to a London straggler. While reading about each author&rsquo;s personal revolution and how they fought to see the beauty of nature and individuals in a constantly industrializing world, I tried to put myself in context of that struggle.</p>

                    <p>As I walked through each new place, I attempted to see both Londons.</p>

                    <p>Sitting in a pub overlooking the River Thames, I envisioned what used to be docklands in the 18th century, where many Chinese immigrants found themselves in a new world. I heard the past echoes of early morning bustling from a meatpacking warehouse. But now, as up-and-coming real estate, the former docklands stand lined with pubs, the only remnants of their history found in the Chinese cuisine and blocked-off alleys to the river that dotted the road.</p>

                    <p>The London I saw and felt wasn&rsquo;t really there, and it prompted me to think about the constantly transitioning city in the context of my own constantly transitioning life. What values did I want to keep, and what did I want to leave behind?</p>

                    <p>As students, professionals or workers, we live by time. Our existence is ruled in terms of the next deadline, the next promotion or the next week that will finally bring the long-awaited break from self-inflicted busy schedules.</p>

                    <p>But for three weeks, I wandered, timeless in the cobbled streets of London.</p>

                    <h2>Florence, Italy</h2>

                    <span class="credit">

                    <p>Walking through the streets of Florence, Italy, stained my white Birkenstocks a dingy brown. The ash from the citizens&rsquo; chain-smoking created a black sealant over every exposed surface. Most days, I spent my time looking down at my blistered toes, avoiding cobblestone ditches and dog poop, all on a sidewalk that fit 0.26 of my person. Scents rotated between heavenly baking pane and the sewage of thousands.</p>

                    <p>And then, whenever I looked up, I saw architecture that dated back centuries. I zigzagged through narrow streets of graffitied buildings, which stood perpendicular to designer stores. On my way to class, I passed the David replica, crossed the Ponte Vecchio and Fiume Arno and attempted to enter the Basilica di Santo Spirito, which holds an original Michelangelo. Firenze is a city that breathes history in addition to pollution. Its locals move at a slower pace, making time for two-hour lunch breaks and kisses on both cheeks.</p>

                    <p>My first weeks in Italy, I fluctuated between grateful, terrified, morose and exhilarated. Having never left the country before, I ignored all my degree requirements to &ldquo;push myself out of my comfort zone.&rdquo; But I hadn&rsquo;t realized that I might have to actually face the repercussions of foreignness while roughly 6,000 miles away from Los Angeles.</p>

                    <p>The thing is, every study abroad experience is more or less the same. I tried to &ldquo;study&rdquo; by exploring my city and traveling to new countries overnight. I was open &ndash; to places and to people &ndash; and constantly ready for the next adventure. I spent most of my money on transportation, cheap booze and castle views. Momentarily, I felt waves of homesickness when confronted with an unexpected cultural barrier, or a friend&rsquo;s first-day-of-school Instagram post. When people say studying abroad will change your life, it isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration. Thanks to the people who let me into their lives, I made a city halfway across the world into a home; their stories are the special ones.</p>

                    <p>For three months, Signora Gabriella Bianchi cooked, cleaned and joked in Italian, while I lived in her spare bedroom. Inarguably the head of the house, Gabriella mocked the simpering princess television shows that her granddaughters, or nipoti, loved &ndash; complaining that intelligent women had worked too hard for this to remain the model for young girls.</p>

                    <p>In Italy, families remain tight-knit &ndash; uniti &ndash; and Gabriella&rsquo;s house held her daughter, son-in-law and three bambini: Sara, age 6; Ghaia, age 4; and il beb&egrave; Zach. The apartment was also shared with three birds, one guinea pig, one kitten and my housemate, Annie Erdahl from Minnesota.</p>

                    <p>A mother to three and host mother to countless, Gabriella put up with my stutters and mispronunciations with loving chagrin &ndash; reminding me her last students spoke only Italian at home. Each evening, a &ldquo;pronto&rdquo; at my door signaled my favorite time of day.</p>

                    <p>Homemade lasagna, stew and tiramis&ugrave; would appear &ndash; and then disappear &ndash; in front of Annie and me. Sempre buoni. Gabriella asked if we wanted seconds while putting them on our plate. Zach giggled at us from his high chair, and tiny Ghaia begged to mango &ndash; or eat &ndash; again.</p>

                    <p>Gabriella has traveled and eaten her way around the world &ndash; from California to Africa to Egypt &ndash; drawing the line at tasting spiders and dog.</p>

                    <p>She likes American action movies, John Steinbeck and &ldquo;Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Marcella Delitala is from Sardegna, an island off the coast of southern Italy. For three hours Monday through Thursday mornings, she taught basic Italian to 20 tired &ndash; and occasionally hungover &ndash; college students. In the course of one semester, Marcella somehow coaxed us through three consecutive language levels. Every morning, she bicycled past me with a &ldquo;buongiorno.&rdquo;</p>

                    <p>Petite and brunette, dressed in flowing pants and sweaters, Marcella is 42 but looks a decade younger. She has three children and claimed she could do without 17 more &ndash; she couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh when half of our questions began with &ldquo;come si dice&rdquo; and &ldquo;che significa.&rdquo; With remarkable energy and exaggerated facial expressions, she rearranged our seats every day and forced a new language into our reluctant brains.</p>

                    <p>With an &ldquo;allora,&rdquo; the class began a piedi. We groaned and circled up as she reached for the tiny colored ball that signaled the beginning of popcorn verb conjugations and counting exercises.</p>

                    <p>Marcella made examples with our names on the board to help ingrain grammar lessons. She took pictures of us on class outings and counted her ducklings as we trailed behind her.</p>

                    <p>She studied abroad in Ohio, does silly dance moves and ordered me chestnut cake &ndash; castagnaccio &ndash; at the farmer&rsquo;s market.</p>

                    <p>Annie Rimmon is a third-year applied mathematics student from Los Angeles with multigenerational Italian roots. Program mates constantly asked us if we were friends pre-arrival, as I blushed from embarrassment.</p>

                    <p>We met last year at UCLA Volunteer Day, where I managed a gardening site at a local elementary school. Annie was a lead volunteer, and she said I was good at being nice &ndash; after which I ignored her on campus. This may or may not be entirely factual, but I cannot imagine my study abroad experience without her.</p>

                    <p>Annie is one of the most genuinely warm people I have ever met &ndash; so warm that she&rsquo;s able to make the people near her feel warm too. She holds an ability to discover patterns and beauty in nearly everything and cares about people to a fault.</p>

                    <p>For the past three months, she kept poking me on the arm &ndash; whether we were looking out over the city from Piazzale Michelangelo or pestering our friend with singing &ndash; and saying, &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re in Italy,&rdquo; reminding me how fortunate we were.</p>

                    <p>She writes her own songs, takes improvisational comedy classes and wants to be a radio host.</p>

                    <p> There were the owners of the corner sandwich shop from school who taught me the Italian names of vegetables. There was the restaurant manager who invited me to his band&rsquo;s jam session. There was the old man who stared out of his garage shop every morning &ndash; as if he was always waiting for someone &ndash; when I walked by for class. There were Italians who adopted me, Italians who catcalled me and Italians who ignored me.</p>

                    <p>My favorite thing about Florence &ndash; not including a gelato from Gelateria Perch&eacute; no! or Gabriella&rsquo;s roasted melanzana &ndash; is the people. Waiting for a check without prompting could take an entire night, and don&rsquo;t count on anything being open in the early morning or afternoon. Tempo al tempo, or all in good time. People in Italy seem content to spend time with their family, eat good food and smoke.</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;m ambitious. But living in Florence has given me perspective on a different pace of life &ndash; with a slowness, and sometimes ineffectiveness, that I probably couldn&rsquo;t maintain for very long. Nonetheless, I hope to return with a greater awareness of all I have to appreciate. And most importantly, I want to return with the same mentality that I embraced while abroad: one of openness, whether that means to the coastline of California, the new neighborhood caf&eacute; or the stranger standing near me at the bookstore.</p>
